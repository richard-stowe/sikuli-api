Sikuli Java API
===============

Sikuli API for Java provides image-based GUI automation functionalities to Java programmers. 
It is created and will be actively maintained by [Sikuli Lab](lab.sikuli.org). The effort of making this API is a 
response to the desire of many Sikuli users to use Sikuli Script's functionalities directly in 
their Java programs, rather than writing Jython scripts. This new Java library has a re-designed 
API and includes several new functions that were not available in the original Sikuli Script.
